Final hunt rule:

```
http.headers_hash:-464000288 http.html_hash:-252957066 port:80 -tag:cdn
```

**Next steps review the other IPs to understand whether HTTP headers and HTML are different. I checked a couple which appeared not to be hosting a C2 panel anymore on port 80. Several results didn't have a shodan result so this is why they are not getting picked up by the hunt rule.**
